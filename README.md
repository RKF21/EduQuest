Introduction:
In this project, we focus on quizzes for different classes and subjects, particularly targeting students in classes 9-10 and 11-12. The web interface provides users the ability to take timed quizzes and submit their answers, with all questions dynamically generated from a database. Additionally, the project includes programming courses to support students' learning in various languages. 

Features:
- User authentication (Login/Logout).
- Dynamic quiz generation based on selected subjects.
- Timer functionality for quizzes.
- Result submission and processing.

 Prerequisites:
- PHP 
- Php Myadmin
- XAMPP local server
- VS Code
- CSS
- 
Installation:
1.Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/EduQuest.git
2. Place the project in the server root: If you are using XAMPP, place the folder in:
   C:/xampp/htdocs/eduquest
3. Start the server: Start your Apache and MySQL server from XAMPP Control Panel.
4.Configure the database:
   Import the eduquest.sql file into your MySQL database.
   Open http://localhost/phpmyadmin in your browser.
   Create a new database named eduquest.
   Import the eduquest.sql file located in the project root directory.
Database Setup:
1. Database: The MySQL database file eduquest.sql contains the necessary table structures and sample data for the quizzes and users. To set up the database:
              Go to phpMyAdmin and import the eduquest.sql file, which will create tables like users, questions, quiz_scores, etc.
2.  Configuring Database Connection: The database connection is already configured in the config.php file located in the Connection folder.

## Prerequisites
- **PHP 7.x or higher**
- **MySQL 5.x or higher**
- **Apache or any other web server**
- **VS Code or another code editor**
  
## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/eduquest.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd eduquest
Place the project in the server root: If you are using XAMPP, place the folder in:

bash
Copy code
C:/xampp/htdocs/eduquest
Start the server: Start your Apache and MySQL server from XAMPP Control Panel.

Configure the database:

Import the eduquest.sql file into your MySQL database. You can do this from phpMyAdmin by following these steps:
Open http://localhost/phpmyadmin in your browser.
Create a new database named eduquest.
Import the eduquest.sql file located in the project root directory.
Database Setup
Database: The MySQL database file eduquest.sql contains the necessary table structures and sample data for the quizzes and users. To set up the database:

Go to phpMyAdmin and import the eduquest.sql file, which will create tables like users, questions, quiz_scores, etc.
Configuring Database Connection: The database connection is already configured in the config.php file located in the Connection folder. You do not need to create a separate connection file; the code for database connection is:

php
Copy code
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
$dbname = "eduquest";

$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
?>
Make sure your database credentials are correct in the config.php file.
